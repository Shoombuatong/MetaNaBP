NaBPred-Fuse is a new computational approach to accurately identify NaBPs. 

The design and development of NaBPred-Fuse based on the multi-view feature fusion strategy can be summarized in the following steps: (i) We constructed 90 base-classifiers trained with six different ML algorithms (i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), partial least squares (PLS), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN)) in combination with the fifteen types of feature descriptors from eight different feature encoding containing multiple perspectives of sequence information; (ii) All the well-trained base-classifiers were applied to generate class and probabilistic information. Then, we combined the class and probabilistic information to construct multi-view features; and (iii) We utilized a two-step feature selection approaches to optimize our feature representations and used the selected features to develop the final model.
